The Locha Mesh is a radio network for communications and Bitcoin transactions without internet or even power grid.
We are working not only in a protocol, but also the firmware for affordable devices like the *Turpial* or *Harpia*.

## What's in the code

* The main software running on Turpial devices (ESP32) can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/locha-mesh-app)

* Our firmware for the ESP32 (Turpial) chip boards can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware)

* Our firmware for the CC1312R radio modules can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware)

* Messages routing protocol code can be found [here]() (link needs to be updated)

* The current React Native mobile app can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/LochaMesh-Chat)

* Find Locha Mesh simulator, datasheets, and more on the [btcven repository](https://github.com/btcven).

* Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/locha/tree/master/documents)

## Supported devices

### Turpial
Is a small and portable device [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp-wroom-32/overview) based system.

Radio module, battery type, and more details are currently described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sjBhGs7FgMGoDsuASq4MyQFnGfmT4qZNib8H_P6eSw/edit)


### Can the Locha Mesh software be installed on other devices?
Sure! We have tested the code in some routers running the OpenWRT OS, also some ARM MCUs can be a good choice. The firmware has a low RAM footprint and we are trying to keep it "vendor agnostic".
