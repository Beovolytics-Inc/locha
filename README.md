# Locha
<Achieving hyperbitcoinization in Venezuela>



## Locha Mesh
The Locha Mesh is a radio network for communications and Bitcoin transactions without internet or even electricity.
We are working not only in a protocol, but also the firmware for affordable devices like the _Turpial_ or _Harpia_.



## What's in the code
* The main software running on Turpial devices (ESP32 LoRa V2) can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/locha-mesh-app)
* Messages routing protocol code can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/locha-mesh-app/blob/master/Turpial/routing_incoming.cpp)
* The current Cordova mobile app can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/btcven/locha/mobile-app) , it runs on Android >5.0

Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/btcven/locha/tree/master/documents)



### Can Locha Mesh software be installed on other devices?

Sure! We have tested the code in some routers running the OpenWRT OS, also some ARM MCUs can be a good choice. The firmware has a low RAM footprint and we are trying to keep it "vendor agnostic".
